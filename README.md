### FUN TO CODE, ENJOY!!!
**Most code here do not have practicle using. We can code anything smart or dump.**

1. First Commit: add some implementations of basic algorithms.

2. Add a DumpKMP Matcher .
 - Usually, we find a substring in another by function"string.find()". I just want to separate charactors first since each charactor may encoded by UTF8 or GBK or just ASCII, and find the substring by KMP.
